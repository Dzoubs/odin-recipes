    <h3>This is a great example of a pepperoni pizza!</h3>
    <p>This recipe is very simple, but it does require some patience!</p>
    <p>Having a pizza oven isn't even required, everything can be done in your cast iron pan!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Dough (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>4 oz. Mozzarella Cheese, grated</li>
        <li>16 slices Pepperoni</li>
        <li>4 oz Fresh Mozzarella Balls, drained, halved</li>
        <li>½ small Red Onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 Sweet Peppers, seeded, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Pinch of Salt and Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>8 Fresh Basil Leaves, torn</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin Olive Oil (for brushing dough)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a 12” diameter or as big as you want, depending on how thick you want the pizza crust.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a tiny bit of semolina over a pizza pan or cast-iron skillet for an easy release.</li>
            <li>Place the dough on a pizza pan. The dough might retract. Oil the tip of your fingers and gently stretch the dough pulling outwards towards you. Use the tip of a fork to prick the dough slightly, careful not to poke through the dough.</li>
            <li>Brush the edge of the dough with extra virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>Next, preheat the oven to 450°F.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pizza using the back of a spoon. Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough, leaving about an inch of crust around the edges. Add a tablespoon at a time.</li>
            <li>Add the pepperoni, top with the fresh and shredded mozzarella (pat dry any excess liquid). Add the onion and peppers. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12 -15 minutes or until the crust is browned. Remove from the oven and finish it off with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
